Every trade has their tools and software development is no different. A good programmer knows his tools better than others and also have access to more powerful and advanced tools than an average programmer, but, there are certain tools which you expect every software developer should know and this list is all about such tools.<BR>
In this list, I am going to share 10 essential tools, which I believe every programmer or software developer should know and know well.
10 Tools Every Programmer Should Know<BR>
Some of you may think 10 tools are nothing but, to be honest, if every programmer knows these truly well, he can accomplish a lot in his day to day job.<BR>
Anyway, without any further ado, let’s see my list of 10 tools every software developer should know and know well.<BR>
<Ol TYPE="1">
	<li>GIT AND GITHUB</li>
	<LI>SQL</LI>
	<LI> PYTHON</LI>
	<LI>EXCEL</LI>
	<LI> WORD</LI>

<P TITLE="GIT AND GITHUB">
<H STYLE="color:BLUE;">
1. Git and Github</H> <BR>
A good knowledge of any source control repository is mandatory for any programmer or software developer because you need to do check-in, checkout of code every day.<BR>
And, to become a better developer you should also know advanced concepts like<I> branching and merging</I>.<BR>
In today’s world, Git and Github have become synonymous with source control repository and version control tool.<BR>
This is the single most important tool for a programmer now and that’s why I suggest every programmer learn Git and Github truly well.<BR>
If you are a beginner or a programmer who wants to improve his Git knowledge, I suggest you to go check out Git Complete: The definitive, step-by-step guide to Git course from <B>Udemy</B>. One of the best course to learn Git in depth.<BR>

2. SQL</H>
<PRE>
This is another essential tool or programming language every programmer should learn. SQL is actually standards Standard Query language and used to work with the database. By using SQL you can read, update, and delete data from tables.
Since we use database everywhere in the real world, a programmer should have a good understanding of SQL.
Apart from knowing basic commands e.g. SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE, a programmer should also know how to write complex queries using joins, aggregate functions, subqueries and other advanced functionalities.</PRE>

If you are new to SQL or want to take your SQL skills to next level then The Complete SQL Bootcamp is a good place to start with.
3. Python
You might be surprised that as a Java developer, why I am suggesting every programmer learn Python? Well, there is a reason for it. Python is a powerful high-level, object-oriented programming language which is very versatile.
You can not only create big applications like you do in Java but also you can use Python to create useful scripts to automate stuff.
It also has numerous modules which make almost anything possible, starting from accessing the file system, developing web applications to machine learning.
I can’t say more but to show you this picture which clearly explains why every programmer should learn Python.

 

It also has simple easy-to-use syntax, making it the perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming for the first time. If you want to learn Python then The Complete Python Bootcamp course is a great place to start with.
4. Excel or any SpreadSheet
The Microsoft Excel is another essential tool for programmers and software developers. Don’t mistake it just for a spreadsheet application, you can do a lot more using Excel then you can ever imagine.
The biggest reason to learn Microsoft Excel is that you will find it everywhere. Everybody uses it, starting from business to BA, QA and project managers. You can use it generate reports, automate and reconcile stuff and a lot more.

 

If you want to go beyond just copy pasting stuff into excel to learn functions like VLOOKUP, I suggest you join the Microsoft Excel — Excel from Beginner to the Advanced course on Udemy. One of the best course to learn Excel in depth.
5. Word or Similar
Microsoft Word is not as popular as Microsoft Excel but still its one of the essential tool for programmers and software engineers.
As a developer, you often need to create documents e.g. software design documents, requirement documents etc and Microsoft Word is the best tool for that.
It provides sophisticated formatting options to create really good looking documentation.

 

If you are a beginner or an intermediate developer who wants to improve your knowledge of Microsoft world then I suggest you go through Master Microsoft Word Beginner to the Advanced course on Udemy.
